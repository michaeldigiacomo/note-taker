# note-taker

When you open the web app, you are faced with the home page.  

As you click "Get Started", the page changes to the actual note taking page. On the left is the notes the user has taken and saved. On the right, the user is able to make new notes. They are able to add both a title, and contents.

To save the information to the left, there is a button in the top right which does so.
